"""Request-correlated log lines for the Render log stream.

gunicorn serves 8 threads, so concurrent requests interleave in the log. Every
line carries the originating request's short id ([a1b2c3]) so one request's
story can be read end to end. The data modules are called from BOTH request
threads and the scheduler's jobs, hence the has_request_context() guard: the
id is simply omitted when there is no request.

Like memlog, every helper swallows its own errors — a logging fault must never
break the work being logged.
