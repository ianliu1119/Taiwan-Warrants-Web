# Taiwan Warrant & Options Scanner

A local web app for scanning Taiwan stock warrants and equity options. It fetches live market data, computes implied volatility, and surfaces potential arbitrage opportunities between warrants and TAIFEX options.

---

## What It Does

The app runs as a local Flask server that auto-opens in your browser. It has four main tabs:

### 1. Warrant Scanner
Fetches live warrant data from CMoney for any supported Taiwan stock. For each warrant it computes:
- **Implied Volatility (IV)** — Black-Scholes IV solved via Brent's method on the ask price
- **Delta** — Black-Scholes delta
- **Real Leverage** — (underlying price × delta) / warrant ask
- **Time Value** and **Time Value %** — extrinsic value as a fraction of the underlying price

Filterable by: option type (Call/Put/All), days to expiry, min leverage, max time value %, min volume.

### 2. IV Surface
Renders a Plotly 3D surface of the warrant IV across strike and DTE. Useful for spotting which warrants are priced rich or cheap relative to the surface.

### 3. Options Scanner
Fetches live TAIFEX equity option data (bid/ask from the last-best-price columns) for supported stocks. Computes IV, delta, and leverage for each contract. Shows whether each quote is a live bid/ask or a settlement-price fallback.

### 4. Arb Finder
Two modes for finding pricing inconsistencies between warrants and options:

#### Direct Match
Pairs each warrant against a same-type option on the same underlying and looks for violations of **call/put monotonicity** — the rule that a higher-strike call must be cheaper than a lower-strike call.

- **Positive price_diff** — the option (higher strike) is more expensive than the warrant (lower strike). Trade: buy warrant, sell option. Entry credit is locked in regardless of where the stock ends up at expiry.
- **Negative price_diff** — the warrant (higher strike) is more expensive than the option (lower strike). Trade: buy option, sell warrant (monitoring only — warrants cannot be shorted in practice).

**Filters:**
- **Max Strike Diff %** — maximum strike difference between the warrant and option as a % of the warrant strike
- **Max DTE Diff (days)** — one-sided cap on the *unfavorable* DTE gap only:
  - For positive direction: caps the days the warrant expires *before* the option (the risky side). If the warrant expires after the option, the gap is unbounded — extra warrant time value only helps.
  - For negative direction: caps the days the option expires *before* the warrant. The safe side is unbounded.

Clicking any row opens a **trade breakdown modal** showing:
- Entry cash flows for each leg at executable bid/ask prices
- A comparison table with IV for both instruments
- A **P&L chart** with two traces:
  - *Dotted line* — theoretical P&L at expiry (intrinsic value only), always ≥ 0 for valid arb pairs
  - *Green line* — mark-to-market P&L at the DTE shown on the slider, using each instrument's Black-Scholes value. Can dip mid-life if IV spreads are large, but the expiry payoff is unaffected.

#### PCP Match (Put-Call Parity)
Uses put-call parity to identify mispricing between call and put warrants via synthetic replication.

## Architecture

```
app.py              Flask routes + arb matching logic
warrant_logic.py    CMoney data fetch, IV/delta/leverage computation
options_logic.py    TAIFEX option data fetch and computation
templates/
  index.html        Single-page frontend (Plotly, vanilla JS)
```

**Data sources:**
- **Warrants** — CMoney private API (`mainpage.ashx`), requires a session `cmkey` token extracted at startup via a headless Playwright/Chromium browser
- **Options** — TAIFEX public CSV download (`optDataDown`)
- **Spot prices** — TWSE MIS API, Yahoo Finance fallback, yfinance fallback

**Key computations:**
- IV solved with Brent's method (bounds `[1e-6, 5.0]`)
- Black-Scholes delta with continuous risk-free rate (Taiwan CBC benchmark, 1.875%)
- All Taiwan equity options use exercise ratio = 2,000 shares/contract
- TXO index options use 50 NT$/point

## Running Locally

```bash
# Requires Python 3.11+ (conda env: warrants)
conda activate warrants
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium   # first time only

# Dev server
python app.py                 # http://127.0.0.1:5001

# Production-style (what deployment uses)
gunicorn -w 1 --threads 8 --timeout 180 -b 0.0.0.0:5001 wsgi:app
```

Exactly **1 gunicorn worker**: market-data caches live in process memory and would diverge across workers; threads provide concurrency.

**macOS only:** if gunicorn workers die with `objc ... fork()` errors on routes that hit yfinance, prefix the command with `OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES`. Linux deployments are unaffected.

---

## Deploy (Render)

The repo ships a `render.yaml` blueprint. In the Render dashboard, create a new **Blueprint** from this repo — it provisions a native Python web service that installs Playwright Chromium at build time and runs gunicorn with a single worker.

After the service is created, set these three secrets in the Render dashboard (they are marked `sync: false`, so Render prompts for them — never commit real values):

- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

The blueprint uses the **starter** plan; the free tier tends to OOM because Chromium is memory-hungry.

### Real-time feed (optional)

The live-quote feed (`fubon_feed.py`, exposed at `GET /live_quotes`) defaults to a
built-in **mock** source (stdlib only, no credentials) so it runs everywhere. To
switch to the real Fubon Neo securities websocket, set these env vars (leave them
unset/empty for the mock — never commit real values):

- `FEED_SOURCE` — `mock` (default) or `fubon`
- `FUBON_ID` — Fubon account id (required when `FEED_SOURCE=fubon`)
- `FUBON_PWD` — Fubon password
- `FUBON_CERT_PATH` — path to the certificate file
- `FUBON_CERT_PWD` — certificate password (may be empty)

`FEED_SOURCE=fubon` additionally requires the `fubon_neo` SDK to be installed (not
in `requirements.txt` yet — the mock path needs no extra dependency).

**Post-deploy:** add the live Render URL (e.g. `https://<service>.onrender.com`) to your Supabase project's **Auth → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs**, or magic-link sign-in will fail.

## Options Exercise Ratios

All Taiwan individual equity options (個股選擇權) on TAIFEX use **2,000 shares per contract**. TXO (index) uses **50 NT$/point**.
